## Reflection Questions
* Working on this project helped me understand TypeScript and object-oriented programming in a much clearer way. When I first started, I wasn’t confident about classes, typing, or how everything connects across different files. I used TypeScript types for each property, and even though I made mistakes, the errors helped me understand what TypeScript expects.

One of the biggest challenges I ran into was with the utility functions like calculateDiscount() and calculateTax(). At first, I kept getting errors saying I was passing too many arguments. I didn’t realize the problem was actually the way I had originally written the functions. Once I updated the function parameters to match how I was calling them in my main file, everything finally started working. 

Another big challenge was working with asynchronous code. I had used fetch before, but using it together with async/await and TypeScript was new to me. I had to learn how to wrap everything in try/catch blocks so errors wouldn’t break the whole program. At first, I didn’t fully understand why errors needed to be rethrown or logged, but after testing failures, it made sense why this matters. Having proper error handling made my code feel more reliable.

Overall, this project helped me understand how TypeScript can actually guide me toward writing cleaner and more organized code. I’m still learning, but now I feel more comfortable creating classes, calling methods, working with modules, and handling asynchronous functions. It was definitely challenging at times, but I learned a lot from fixing my mistakes and seeing the application come together piece by piece.
